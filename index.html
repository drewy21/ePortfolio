<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>
<b>Name:</b> Samuel Drew <br>
<b>Student ID:</b> s3921243 <br>
<b>Email:</b> s3921243@student.rmit.edu.au <br>
<b>Nationality:</b> Australian	<b>Culture:</b> Anglo-saxon Australian<br>
<b>Education:</b> Bachelor of Visual Arts, Graduate Diploma of Education (Federation University), Bachelor of Information Technology (studying at RMIT).<br>
<b>Languages:</b> English, Korean (learning)<br>
<b>Background:</b> I was born, raised and lived most of my life in regional Victoria, on the outskirts of Ballarat. My primary education was in a small country school and secondary education at an independent school in Ballarat. I was influenced with a creative streak from my father’s home-based pottery business, which lead me to study a ceramics course at TAFE then later apply and switch to the University of Ballarat (Now Federation Uni) to finally attain my bachelor’s degree in Visual Arts. At a loose end having completed my degree and returning from a short stint living in Ireland, I proceeded to study for and gain my secondary teaching qualification back at the University of Ballarat. After completing a short teaching contract locally, It wasn’t long before I took off to South Korea to teach English in an after-school academy school. It was there that I met my wife, married and we had our handsome son. We moved back and forth to Australia and finally decided to make a life back here in Ballarat, Australia, where I have been a technology teacher for the past 12 years.
Interesting Fact: My teaching methods at University were Visual Arts and Visual Arts, which was kind of limiting. I had learned of another visual arts-teaching student who enrolled himself in some joinery units at TAFE to help skill himself up to get a foot in the door as a woodwork teacher (technology teacher). I followed suit and was snapped up at a local public school on a contract. On my return from an English teaching position in South Korea, I landed a job as a welding/ metal work teacher with next to no experience and had to teach myself the skills to teach the students, somehow. I soon came to the realisation that metal working was not for me, being way to dirty and dangerous for my liking or skill level. Luckily, I saw an opportunity during an internal department reshuffled and moved across to take electronics, which I loved, but new very little about it, at the time. Everything I know in this field has been self-taught and I’m still learning after 11 years, which is why I’m enjoying it, so much. This has included learning about circuits and integrated circuit design, Printed Circuit Board making at home, 3D printing, Robotics and a range of programming skills.

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>
<h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3> When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
My interest in IT stems from my need to know, and about empowerment in this digital ecosystem that is infiltrating more and more aspects of our daily lives. By understanding it I hope to prepare and protect myself and those around me, as well as create a space that is useful and dynamic. The beginnings of my IT interest stem back to my secondary years when my father decided to purchase a Commodore 128 computer, second hand, to shut up my pestering younger brother. This computer came with guidebooks on how to set up the computer as well as a book on programming in the Basic Programming language. This began a journey of discovery as I tried to create my own game, which was not a success. My mother convinced me that my later purchase of an Amiga 500 from a secondary school friend was not a great idea, and I gave back the computer, but the want to program still remained. It was not until many years later on becoming a technology teacher that my interest in programming was re-ignited. Getting into teaching forced me to use computer and IT concepts on a daily basis as the job required it for student management, lesson delivery and daily communication and staff training. I was also frustrated at IT issues that I couldn’t fix myself, instead relying on an over-worked IT department at my school. This urged me to seek a way to find out more about how computers, programs and networks operated, someday. A school colleague had taken the plunge to re-skill by studying a degree in IT, which sowed the seed for me to return back to study after 20 years of my last stint at University.
Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
The choice to go to RMIT was an easy one based on its reputation as a leading University in Victoria. It also helped that my father was a student there many, many years ago and a good friend attended there some time ago, with positive experiences. My wife more recently completed an honours degree in fashion design,and she was very satisfied with the challenge, the staff support, and with their extensive industry experience to help guide her in a life after university. The flexibility that this online course gives me is very appealing as I can study when time allows, as well as hold down a teaching position in my regional school without the need for nasty commuting. I saw my wife do this for 3 years in her studies and it made for extremely long days.
What do you expect to learn during your studies?
Personally, I consider myself as a self-starter who is well organised and motivated to learn anything I put my mind to. My passion is for the power and creativity of programming, along with the challenge of problem solving by working through problems and giving myself time to come up with a solution. I’m like a Jack Russell with a bone, I just have to find a solution to the problem at hand. Sometimes this may mean leaving it to stew for a period of time, but I get there eventually. My problem with self-study and relying on endless ‘Youtube’ videos is that it doesn’t allow for networking, working others and working with others with industry experience. I would also like to get a sense of the IT market and where the growth areas are for the space. Some more exposure and challenges with programming is the core of what I’m wanting with this course, as up to a certain point programming does get a little difficult for my secondary students, except for an exceptional few. I’m also not too knowledgeable with computer hardware and networking fundamentals.
By the end of this degree, I expect to have a finger on the pulse of the IT industry and its possibilities. I would also expect to have a clearer picture in terms of what I want to do in this field, whether that is still related to education or another area that excites me. With that decision, I would expect to have the skills, confidence and some experience to apply for those jobs.

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
<p>What do the results of these tests mean for you?
The results of the three tests mostly confirmed what I already understand about my personality, based on being middle aged and with a number of life experiences behind me, to highlight these. It confirmed my somewhat introverted personality, but it didn’t really explain that the condition does change depending on the situation I am put in, social situations I’m reserved, but with a task to do and in a comfortable situation I do become more involved and willing to engage and exchange ideas. The Myer-Briggs test suggests that I have an introverted leaning, but that I may not assert my ideas if there are strong personalities in the group, but I would seek to include all group members in activities. It shows that I’m imaginative and open-minded when it comes to ideas and solutions, but also organised, decisive and I value a planned approach to tasks. The Vark test highlights a kinesthetic approach to learning, meaning I value hands on experience, more so, than other learning styles. The big five highlights a strong work ethic, intellect and a need to get along with others, yet I can be prone to stress and frustration with overly challenging situations.
How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
I think that a leadership role is possible, but I would work better in a support role, especially looking at my reaction in stressful situations. Structure and a methodical way of working are important for me to understand and tackle tasks and I would seek to plan a clear path for the groups end goal, to be most efficient with time and resources. I would need to get to know the team I’m working with first, to feel more comfortable in presenting ideas and giving or receiving feedback. I believe I would seek and enjoy supporting any member of the team who wanted it, but show flexibility when comes to decision making
How should you take this into account when forming a team?
I perhaps wouldn’t do so well in a group with too many strong personalities that did not get along. I see my best fit as a planning, supporting role that would enjoy the brainstorming of ideas. I would be willing to compromise on a decision, if it lead to better group cohesion. A group could rely on me to lift my weight, as I’m goal oriented and work hard to get a positive result.

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<p>
<h3>Overview (100)</h3>
This project brings together a range of technologies to create an ‘open-source gaming platform’ that is very accessible to secondary students with a computer and some easy to source parts. It will allow the students to design their own original game controller that can be customised easily to their taste with simple materials and a small amount of soldering for wiring. There will be an interfacing box created that connects the controller to a computer. With the use of an open-source program, the students can develop their own open-source games with the controller to interact with the game, instead of regular keyboard controls. The aim of this project is to make a connection between hardware and software through an instantly engaging topic for secondary aged students.
<h3>Motivation(100)</h3>
This project idea was hatched from a year 8 technology subject at my school. There were two modules to this subject, one including programming using some free software and the other working with simple electronic circuits from cardboard, copper tape and a small range of electronic components. These two areas were somewhat related, but there wasn’t a strong connection between the two. I identified that this was the case and came up with an idea that could bring the two together, which involves the use of a simple cardboard control circuit to interact with a programmed game on a computer. The Arduino platform appears to be the key to make this connection.
<h3>Description(500)</h3>
This project has 3 main parts to it, with a game controller, an interfacing box and the gaming software. This makes up the open-source gaming platform I wish to develop for use with junior secondary school aged students as a way to engage students in a pass time that is already popular for their age bracket. This is to help establish connections between the programming side and the hardware side to interact and provide inputs to it.
The project starts with a simple game controller that students are able to construct with a paper template, cardboard, pine timber and adhesive copper tape, that needs to be glued together and cut to size and fitted. Once the controller is constructed it will need to be wired by preparing and soldering on the hook up wire. I would suggest a set design for the students first,  so that they have a greater chance of success at getting it to work, before they could be allowed to modify or come up with their own design.
The next part would be the development of the interfacing box, that is the bridge between the game controller and the game played on the computer. The interfacing box is simply an Arduino Nano placed in an adapter board that has screw terminals to easily allow the hook up of the wiring from the game controller and an Arduino cable to connect to the computer. The interfacing box will require a 3D printed case for presentation, safety and to keep it clean. This will require the design of a case in Tinkercad to be exported as an STL file for printing on a 3D printer. The Arduino can then be screwed securely to the printed case for safe usage.
The hook up wire from the game controller is then screwed into place on the Arduino adapter board paying special attention to which pins they are attached to. The interfacing box is connected via the USB cable to the computer. A serial sketch will need to be developed which tests to see that the buttons on the game controller work and work correctly. The game controller will have some sort of directional control buttons as well as other function buttons for other actions required by the game played. They are all essentially simple push switches.
The last part of the project is the game program. Processing 3 will be used due to its ease of use by students. A simple test sketch needs to be developed that listens for serial communication. Likewise, the Arduino will need a sketch that takes the input from the controller and sends a serial signal to the computer through the connected USB cable.
Once the serial communication is successful and an action can be enabled then other actions such as directional movement can be calibrated in with specific serial signals. This may be tested by the use of moving box around the Processing window. Following this the other buttons are to be calibrated for control.
With successful serial communication between the controller, interfacing box and the Processing program, a start-up game can be used by students to get a feel for the controller. Something along the lines of Pong or Snake. From here games such as Space invader and alike can be developed and built upon.
<h3>Tools and Technologies(100)</h3>
•	Hardware: Arduino nano, adapter board, hook up wire, timber, cardboard, copper tape, foil, USB cable, 3D printed case, laptop computer.
•	Software: Arduino IDE to program the serial connection, Processing 3 or P5.js application for game creation, Tinkercad 3D modelling web application, Flashforge 3D printer driver software, MS Word for controller template design
•	Reference sites: Arduino.cc, Processing.org, Tinkercad tutorials, youtube videos, related forums.
<h3>Skills Required(100)</h3>
Arduino skills: Pin layout, connection by usb and com port, C++ programming language, IDE usage, Serial monitor usage for problem solving, circuit connection.
Processing skills: Java programming language, game construction and logic.
Tinkercad skills: basic modelling techniques, export project as an .stl file.
Flashforge skills: import and orientate project, print settings.
MS Word: manipulate shapes for accurate controller template layout.
<h3>Outcome(100)</h3>
What will be the outcome?
The opportunity for students to experiment with the creation of a self-designed gaming platform with their own branding along with the chance to develop or customise games themselves. This will help to engage students in both fields of study.
How will the original problem be solved?
Students will be more engaged and see the connection between programming and electronics which essentially underpins the whole gaming field, giving students understanding and buy in to the importance of technology in their daily lives.
What impact will this development have?
As stated, the students will have a greater sense of purpose in applying the skills they have learnt in the two somewhat separate modules, but with more students involved in this platform a community of makers can be established beyond the walls of a single school.
