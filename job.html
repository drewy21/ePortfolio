    <h4>My description of the skills, qualification and experience I already have</h4>
    <p>My experience and knowledge are very limited when it comes to blockchain, but I’m familiar in principle to blockchain and its decentralised nature, which is what attracts me. I’ve looked at some introductory videos on solidity and made some weak attempts to learn it. I have some beginner experience with vanilla javascript, but no experience with popular libraries being used like React, etc. In short, my experience is limited and I have plenty to learn.
    My personal plan for obtaining skills, qualifications and experience for the position
    <ol>
      <li>Understand what the requirements are, especially the ones I’m not familiar with or have never heard of, like Rust, Redux, SQS, AWS for example.</li>
      <li>Get familiar with the public platforms of the open-source development community and start contributing (Medium, Github, Bitbucket, Stackoverflow, etc.).</li>
      <li>Get involved in some online tutorials to get up to speed with solidity, whether it’s free or paid (Youtube, Skillshare, Udacity, Udemy, etc.).</li>
      <li>Improve my vanilla Javascript skills through more practice and working with tutorials to a confident level.</li>
      <li>With solid skills in Javascript look at exploring the libraries of React, Redux and Vue.js. This may mean undertaking a paid online course to get the best results.</li>
      <li>Undertake some training with cloud computing with a focus on AWS, Google cloud, Azure to start through a course on ‘A cloud guru’.</li>
      <li>Having a solid grasp of steps 1 – 6, look to gain some unpaid work experience with a business or company or anyone willing to let me work with them for experience and learning.</li>
      <li>Then look at some of the specialisation to the job requirements like API integration, PM tool experience, etc.</li>
      <li>Then it is a matter of building a portfolio of projects and experience that I can showcase and talk about with confidence.</li>
      <li>Apply for graduate jobs when the opportunity presents itself to build experience. Then go for a similar job when I have enough experience behind me.</li>
    </ol>
